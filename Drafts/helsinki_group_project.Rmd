title: "A data-driven typology of elected representative"
description: |
  The key element in any type of democracy is representation. Consequently, representatives, specifically the elected representatives, occupy the central role in day-to-day functioning of any democracy. We aim to develop a data driven typology of elected representatives based on their individual features, such as demographics, party affiliation, and more importantly their representation activity. To this end, we utilize a set of indicators from Singaporean national parliament covering the span of 2011-2020.
